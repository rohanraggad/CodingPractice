You are given an array representing block heights 
You need to calculate how much water an individual bar can trap 

Example: 
heights = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
output: 6

Idealogy is to find maximum height block in the left and maximum block height in the right.
Then from these two we will find minimum height block present either to the left or right of the current blocks.
The found minimum height - current block height will give us the water that can be trapped at current block 

Approach 1: BRUTE FORCE
At each and every block we will find left max and right max meaning n2 complexity

Approach 2: PRE CALCULATE LEFT MAX AND RIGHT MAX
