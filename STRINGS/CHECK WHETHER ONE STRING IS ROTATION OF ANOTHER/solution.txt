Question :=>
You are given two strings:
s1 = ABACD
s2 = CDABA 
So You can see that if left rotate s1 two times we will get s2 

Solution :=>
if length(s1) == length(s2) then only we can proceed further
Best Solution: 
            Add s1 with s1 and find whether s2 is substring of the resultant
            If s2 is a substring of resultant then s2 is rotation of s1
Naive Solution: 
            Run a loop for length(s1) times and rotate s1 by 1 in each run and compare whether s2 is obtained
            If for loop completes and s2 is not obtained then s2 is not rotation of s1
